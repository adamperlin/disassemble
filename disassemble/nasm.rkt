;; Taken from Larceny, written by Felix Klock

;;; Experimental library to get us semi-reliable IA32 disassembly by
;;; delegating the job to the nasm disassembler ndisasm.
;;;
;;; Note that the output can be misleading especially because we
;;; currently encode exception codes directly in the instruction
;;; stream, which the disassembler has no knowledge of. (To find this
;;; in the IAssassin backend, just search for the token 'dwords'; that
;;; is the directive for emitting constants in Sassy.)
